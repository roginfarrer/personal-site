This page exists to demonstrate the visual styles of the various elements that comprise the design of this site. I got the idea and some of the text from [Dan Eden](http://daneden.com/styleguide). This is not only for my own benefit, as the designer and maintainer, but also to satisfy the curiosity of those interested in such things (like myself).

At the time of writing (November 26, 2014), body copy is set in Ratio. Headlines are set in the same.

### Biggest heading level

Second level headings are used to split text into sections. First level headings are only used once per page, in the page or post title. Hyperlinks are [underlined](/) and darkened when hovered.

For emphasis, **bold text** is very useful to make words pop. For important, but less urgent points, _italicized text_ becomes handy.

* Bulleted lists look like this.
* Sometimes my lists are long.
* This is not one of those lists.

#### Second biggest heading level

Third level headings are most often used to denote names rather than sections, so have a lower visual priority. Headings should avoid containing or being themselves hyperlinks, but when this rule is broken, heading hyperlinks do not differ in style from the heading itself.

1.  This is a numbered list.
2.  Numbered lists are useful.
3.  Especially when one knows how to count.

Sometimes my posts get long enough they require a page break. I don't use them very often, but here's an example of one:

<hr />

I do lot of reading, and it's useful to use quotations when referencing them. Here's an example of a blockquote.

> I increased the font size and offset the text for emphasis. That way no can mistake it as my own, because plagiarism is bad. Unless I'm quoting Ernest Hemingway. If that's the case, I want you to think it's my writing.

Like line breaks, I don't use images often, but I want them to pack a punch when I do.

So this was my style guide. Hope you get a kick out of it.
